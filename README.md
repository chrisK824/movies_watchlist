* Create a python virtual environment by running the following command:
`python3.9 -m venv python_venv`
* Activate the python virtual environment by running the command:
`source python_venv/bin/activate`
* Install requirements of testing environment by running the following command:
`pip3 install -r testing_requirements.txt`
* Install requirements of app by running the following command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the automated tests by invoking the `pytest` utility by running the following command:

`
NOTE:
If the test suite has ran before, make sure to delete the derived sqlite3db named "books_reviews.db",
which in that case would be present in the same folder, so that the tests are not affected by any previous inserted records
